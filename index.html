      <p class="item-name">Chicken</p>
      <p>Chickens are classified by their principal products into egg, dual-purpose (meat and eggs), and meat breeds. Each has specific anatomical and physiological characteristics. Laying hens are small, grow rapidly, and mature early. The meat and dual-purpose breeds are larger, have well-developed muscles, and mature later.Roosters develop bony processes, spurs, on the lower part of the metatarsus. Both hens and roosters have crests, which come in such shapes as leaf (with several teeth), rose, and pea. Hens of egg breeds most commonly have leaf crests, which fall to the side at the second or third tooth. The beak is slightly curved. In most breeds, the beak and metatarsus are the same color: yellow, pale pink, black, and so on. Plumage color varies.</p>

      <p class="item-name">Beef</p>
      <p>Every year, we mine the data to determine what ended up on the fan-favorite list. At this point, we've done this long enough that we know there's a few topics that are always going to make the list: fencing, animal health...because really, when should you castrate that bull calf?... and new products. In fact, the number one story has been the most-read story for years and we'd be the first to bet that it's the most-read article on BEEF's website ever. (What's it about? You'll have to click through to see! Even if you've already read it, it's one you should read again and again and again!).And while we are big fans of writing content that becomes a go-to resource for you for years to come (we're talking about #5!), we also know there's hundreds of stories that didn't make this list, but that made just as important of an impact in 2019.

      <p class="item-name">Sushi</p>
      <p>Sushi originates in the Baiyue cuisine in ancient southern China, a dish known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time.The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevents the fish from spoiling; the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour"; the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[6] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.[<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>
